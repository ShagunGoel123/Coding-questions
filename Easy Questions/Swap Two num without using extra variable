Problem:

You are given two numbers a and b. Your task is to swap the given two numbers.
Note: Try to do it without a temporary variable.

Solution:

class Solution{   
public:
    pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        //complete the function here
        a = a^b;
        b = a^b;
        a = a^b;
        return pair<int, int>(a,b);
        
    }
};
