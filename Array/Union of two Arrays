Problem:

Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find the number of elements 
in the union between these two arrays.
Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays.
If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.
Note : Elements are not necessarily distinct.

Example 1:

Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the
elements which comes in the union set
of both arrays. So count is 5.


Example 2:

Input:
6 2 
85 25 1 32 54 6
85 2 
Output: 
7
Explanation: 
85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, and
2 are the elements which comes in the
union set of both arrays. So count is 7.



Solution:

class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to return the count of number of elements in union of two arrays.
    int doUnion(int a[], int n, int b[], int m)  {
        //set is used to not obtain duplicates
        set<int>ans;
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            ans.insert(a[i]);
        }
        for(int j=0;j<m;j++)
        {
            ans.insert(b[j]);
        }
        // count how many elements in set
        for(int r=0;r<ans.size();r++)
        {
            count++;
        }
       return count;
    }
};
